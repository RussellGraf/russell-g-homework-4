			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I graduated from The University of Hartford Cum Laude. I completed my major in Advertising and Public Relations and my minor in Graphic Design and therefore feel that I have a great deal to offer. Of course there is so much more that I would love to learn.</p>

			<p>I am a driven and hard working individual who is always eager to learn. I approach new challenges with great determination and perform quite well under pressure. I am currently working on projects for a wide range of clients, from the financial sector, to a homemade tea company, that are often time sensitive and quite diverse. Having worked on ads, maps, websites, T-shirts, packaging, pamphlets and more, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of different assignments. When there is a task given to me that I am not familiar with, I make it my duty to learn quickly preform to the best of my abilities.</p>

			<p>I hope that I have the opportunity to show you what I am capable of.</p>
